    # Theory of operation:
    # Step 1) Read an image file into opencv (cv2) image structures, ipl, and a gray scale version, src_gray:
    src_gray = cv2.imread(image_file, cv2.IMREAD_GRAYSCALE)
    ipl = cv2.imread(image_file, 1)

    # Uncomment to see the cv2 image, useful for debugging)
    # cv2.imshow("Example", ipl)
    # cv2.waitKey(0)
    # cv2.destroyAllWindows()

    # Step 2) Convert an RGB image to an HSV image:
    # HSV will be useful to identify the TRUE colors of circular markers.  The colors allow us to distinguish
    # which marker is in which clock position (and therefore we know its absolute 3D x,y,z position).
    # Pixels might be in bright light, in shadow or in a reflected color of the impressions.
    # Such conditions change the Saturation (S) and the brightness Value (V) of the perceived pixel by a lot,
    # but are only likely to change the Hue (H) by a little. The RGB values will also all change a lot,
    # so using HSV allows us to just try to find the closest match in the Hue (H) space.

    hsv = rgb_to_hsv(ipl)

    # STEP 3: Edge Recognition of Colored Circles.
    # The following operations are used to identify, and emphasize black and white pixel boundaries (Edges).
    # Our circular color markers each have an outer black edge, with an inner white edge, and then a colored interior.
    # This makes it easy for us to distinguish these objects from other images on the floor, sides, or impression.

    # We use the next operations on the src_gray image to create a black and white image
    # of just the edges (in white) and the background becomes black.

    # Open-Close morphology operations
    open_morphology = 2     # reduces noise in background,

    #  STEP 4: Detect edges using canny algorithm

    # By recognizing at least 3 markers on the floor, we can see where their light rays intersect the 2D camera sensor.
    # That in turn allows us to calculate in (x, y, z) 3D space exactly where the camera which took
    # this particular image must be located.

    # The photogrammetry algorithm reverses this process, using at least 3 images and identifying a single
    # position visible in all of them. It then calculates how far each point on the target is from the known
    # camera positions. Given the calculated distances between the camera positions and the angle of where the
    # points on the target appear from each camera, photogrammetry draws triangle and uses triangulation to
    # precisely locate where the imaged point on the target must be in 3D space.

    # For each image we will try to recognize as many marker positions as possible,
    # but some shapes found will be low confidence.  THEORETICALLY, including MORE
    # of these marker locations in the information we provide the photogrammetry algorithm should improve
    # its accuracy.

    # HOWEVER, the greater the error in any marker position we provide the photogrammetry algorithm,
